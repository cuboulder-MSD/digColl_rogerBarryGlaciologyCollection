# Roger G. Barry Glaciology Collection Expedition Notebooks and Reports 1903-1975
## Description

These expedition notebooks and reports come from the Roger G. Barry glaciology collection, which was received from the National Snow and Ice Data Center in 2017. These notebooks document early White expeditions to Alaska and U.S. National Parks to document glaciers and ice. Some notebooks also contain daily logs documenting observations such as weather and occasional interactions with indigenous communities. The expedition books come from Lawrence Martin, Louis L. Ray, Harry Fielding Reid and National Park Service glacier surveys. The Martin notebooks (1903-1913) study advances and recessions of glaciers in the southern part of Alaska funded by the National Geographic Society. The Ray notebooks from 1904-1911 contain field notes and diary reports from expeditions to Alaska from those dates, and the 1931 notebooks document his expedition with C.K. Wentworth in 1931 for the U.S. Geological Survey. The Reid notebooks describe his expeditions to Alaska in 1890-1892 and consist of daily weather reports, discussions of travel, glacier observations and sketches of landscapes including glaciers. The National Park Service Glacier Survey Reports date from 1919-1975 and consist of repeat surveys of the glaciers within Mount Rainier National Park, Glacier National Park, Yosemite National Park, Rocky Mountain National Park, and Nisqually glacier.
